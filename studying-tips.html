									<h2>Studying Tips</h2>
									<p>Here are 5 tips for studying and completing homework assignments</p>
								</header>
								<ol>
									<li>Create a designated study area.</li>
									<p>
										Having a dedicated place to study can help you get into the right mindset. Choose a spot separate from your bed and other relaxation areas. As someone who used to procrastinate and tried doing assignments in bed, I can tell you it doesn't work. The goal is to send a signal to your brain that it's time to study.
									</p>
									<li>Establish a consistent study time.</li>
									<p>
										In addition to having a study spot, it's important to set a specific time for studying and stick to it. While it may seem like you have endless time, remember that time is limited. By allocating a fixed study time, you can ensure that you complete your work and still have free time afterward.
									</p>
									<li>Reward yourself for sticking to your study schedule.</li>
									<p>
										Studying at home may not always be enjoyable, but consider the positive side: you're developing self-discipline, a valuable life skill. After successfully adhering to your study schedule, reward yourself with an activity you find enjoyable.
									</p>
									<li>Consider using the Pomodoro Technique.</li>
									<p>
										The Pomodoro Technique involves focused work for 25 minutes, followed by a 5-minute break. After four intervals, take a longer break of 15-30 minutes. During the work periods, eliminate distractions to maintain focus. The anticipation of a break can provide motivation. Learn more about this technique <a href='https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique' target='_blank'>here</a>.
									</p>
									<li>Begin with the most challenging assignment.</li>
									<p>
										It can be helpful to start with the assignment you find most difficult or the least appealing. Sometimes, the reason you don't want to do a particular task is because you believe it's beyond your abilities. Break down large assignments, such as research papers, into smaller tasks, like starting with research, and gradually progress from there.
									</p>
					
								</ol>
							
								<p>
									Remember, these are quick tips to aid you in completing assignments and studying with the intention to learn. However, I want to caution you about relying too heavily on resources like ChatGPT. Use such resources to assist you in your assignments, but remember that the purpose of homework is to learn, not just to get it done.
