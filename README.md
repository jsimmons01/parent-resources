#Student Resources

##Why did I build this project?

This is a one stop shot for free resources parents and studnets can use to help with completing homework assignments and studying. As the school year was coming to an end, I knew that I was going to lose students for the summer break and I might not ever tutor them again. I wanted to leave them with a resource guide for next school year because it is possible they will not be able to get a tutor. 

##What problem does it solve?

A lot of these resources are easy to search, however, searching for resources on your own can be a hassle especially if it is crunch time. I wanted something parents and students can access without having to vet resources themselves. All of these resources are free or have free versions that are beneficial. 

##Description
I used Dopetrope template from HTML5UP.net to have my basic style. Since my goal was to create a website for parents to use immediately I didn't want to get boggled down in all the styling choices I could make. Therefore this project is HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript that I have to look at closer to see what it is actullay doing. 

##What did you learn?

I learned how to clone a repository from github to my local repo. 
I learned how to update my local repo to the remote repo by simply writing pull.  
I also learned that it better to resize images instead of simply adding the original size to my project. 
I refreshed my memory on how to link to sections on the page.
